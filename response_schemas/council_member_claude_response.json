        "Step 3: Analyzed strategic risk - B2B to B2C pivots require fundamentally different capabilities (marketing channels, customer support scale, unit economics) and the proposal lacks specifics about readiness for this transformation.",
        "Step 4: Weighed ethical considerations - recommending a major strategic pivot without sufficient data could harm stakeholders (employees, investors, customers) if the decision leads to resource depletion or business failure.",

In this case, the proposal presents a high-stakes strategic question without sufficient context for responsible evaluation. Rather than defaulting to support or opposition based on incomplete data, I prioritize epistemic humility - recognizing that responsible guidance requires understanding the specific business context, market dynamics, competitive landscape, and organizational readiness. The abstention reflects commitment to nuanced decision-making over superficial pattern-matching, and signals that the proposer should develop more comprehensive analysis including customer research, financial modeling, capability assessment, and scenario planning before executing such a significant pivot."
